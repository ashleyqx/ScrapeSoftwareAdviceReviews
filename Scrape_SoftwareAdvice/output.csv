It has a fast and intuitive user interface. No corners have been cut and the features are impressive.

No other tech company comes close to the high standards Dundas has set for service and reliability.",There is only a small community of users compared to bigger solutions. It's not the fault of Dundas. It's a niche product and it's something to consider.

Dundas BI Reviews,Luca,Intralot,4.0,4.0,,3.5,,A really good DataVisualizzation tool.,,"I have not had the opportunity to delve in detail this product as I wanted, we have created several dashboards and reports in the evaluation phase of the software and must say it is really a great product, quick enough to develop after a little practice and a lot attractive.  The strength of Dundas BI is definitely its optimization for tablets and mobile devices, it is a SharePoint integrated software, you can use several different data sources, all the most common including OLAP, the development interface is very linear and intuitive.  It has several interesting features such as the functionality of the dynamic system (directly from the dashboard so no need for IT side changes) and useful homescreen user interface so that each user can customize their own ""home.""","The software is really good and attractive, just about the license cost of Dundas BI is not very cheap, furtherermore if you want to upgrade your product it requires a payment additional subscription."

It's ease of usability spearheaded by its drag and drop methodology makes it easy to pick right up and start visualizing your data. I continue to find new and improved possibilities over past products used - so the future is looking bright with Dundas BI.","The easy to use drag and drop capabilities. Also, often forgotten, and also in many instances - a pain, the easy to use Update wizard is a breeze with DundasBI... makes the updates that Dundas pushes very exciting.  ","Not much on this side yet, but have had a couple nuances that Dundas has found to be bugs - but none that their customer support team hasn't already relayed to their developers."
Dundas BI Reviews,Tom,Family HealthCare Network,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,Dundas BI is a fantastic tool,"Dundas BI is a fully realized BI system providing beautiful data visualizations in a easy to use interface.

Dundas' support team is great. ",Ease of use and beautiful data visualizations. ,Nothing
Dundas BI Reviews,Kevin,Coastline Gaming,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,Quality product exceptional service,After a little learning Dundas BI is a powerful tool with enough functionality for most enterprise environments.  Easy to deploy with a simple architecture.,"Speed of deployment is a real plus.  Customized white labeling, multitenancy, and a simple administration interface make this a powerful tool.",Does take a little learning and needs a big server Ram for in memory processing.
Dundas BI Reviews,Devon,Tenaska Power Services Co,4.5,4.0,4.5,4.5,,Great product that balances Ease-of-use with Functionality well.,,"Striking the balance between functionaility and ease-of-use, Dundas BI is accessible while remaining robust, which is unusual for this type of software. The out-of-the-box functionality is deep, and most things you cannot do natively can be scripted using Javascript. The learning curve is short to get started creating high level visualizations. ","The depth is nearly unlimited, however you have to know Javascript (or be willing to learn it) to get functionality that isn't native to the product. As the product is relatively new, there are some bugs, but they have a reasonably fast release cycle and those bugs are squashed quickly and/or have an acceptable short-term workaround. Sometimes it is difficult to understand what an error means without some technical background, but their support makes up for this."
Dundas BI Reviews,Jacqui,Bespoke Software,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,,Fast dashboard development,,Product: That they have taken the HTML5 path and eventually the tool will become more responsive so solution providers can get closer to the  build once and deploy on any device nirvana that clients are coming to expect.  Vendor: The awesome support team.  Always very responsive to any queries that we have had.,"Product: The navigation paradigm for people who don't embed this tool in another application, but rather use it as a stand alone tool. You pretty much need to roll your own.  Vendor: That they don't have the exposure yet that some of the other BI tool providers.  It is harder to convince a client to consider a product that they haven't heard about.  We in no way think this reflects on the capability of the product."
Dundas BI Reviews,Christoph,Siemens AG,4.5,5.0,4.5,4.0,,Our go to data visualization tool,,"We do like the flexibility, especially through the open API as well as the performance of the entire dashboard. Integration into our own infrastructure was very easy. The performance of cubes (especially when build in-memory) is fantastic.","Because the product is very new, I wouldn't call it feature complete yet. On the data visualization side of things, we have everything we need, but we need more options in the (still brand new) ETL module. Mainly we need to be able to change data after aggregation has happened (e.g. in case you do not want to show results if the base is too low)."
Dundas BI Reviews,Kenneth,Visiting Angels,5.0,5.0,,5.0,,Excellent BI Integrations!,,Dundas BI is really a one of a kind type of platform that can give critical insights to any organization. Without these insights you really don't know what you're missing. Must try!,It took some time to really train on the platform and understand how to manage the analytics. With some time you can get a good grip on everything.
Dundas BI Reviews,Andrew,G4S,4.5,3.5,5.0,4.5,,Quick and Easy KPI's for the masses,,The software is great - the latest versions of the dashboard are contemporary and look great.  The company is friendly and always on hand to help.,The software is not particularly cheap - which does mean that mass take up could be expensive for many named users.  
Dundas BI Reviews,Christian,"SupplyCore, Inc.",4.0,4.0,,4.0,,Flexible time Saver ,,"Before we used Dundas, I had to go to IT for every small report. Changes to already set up reports took the same amount of time and effort. Basically there was usually a significant delay, before I got the information I needed and sometimes it was tiresome, to explain to the IT person what exactly I needed. With Dundas I am able to create and send reports in just a few minutes. And changes are usually just a drag and a few clicks away. Dundas also helped us getting better insight in our operations. We were able to focus our compliance review on problem areas instead of randomly poking around. All in all, Dundas saved us a lot of time and our IT team is much happier and can focus on more important things.","It took a while to get to the point, where I did not have to rely on help from IT. I am also missing an easy way, to do some advanced calculations and creating new tables from them."
Dundas BI Reviews,Charlie,Cleveland Clinic Foundation,4.5,4.0,3.5,5.0,,Very Intuitive,,Product: The balance between ease of use and flexibility to customize  Vendor: Our Account Rep Denise,Support has been more difficult requiring long detailed emails be sent instead of directly speaking with someone on the phone when the issue is something beyond a simple fix

Dundas BI Reviews,Corey,ADT Security,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,Easy and Quick BI experience,"I have had a great experience with Dundas BI so far.  The standard controls and features are great, and being able to leverage Javascript alongside the built in tools has enabled us to do some really cool things with our dashboards.  I am still a beginner as far as BI goes, but I've been able to pick up Dundas BI and build several dashboards so far without any problems.","It is simple to use, but has a lot of great features and customization options.","Some parts of the program took some getting used to since there are so many options available, but once you get used to where to find certain options it isn't that bad."

Dundas BI Reviews,Dan,ISI,5.0,4.5,5.0,5.0,,Great BI Platform to Satisfy Broad Spectrum of BI Stakeholders,,"This is a well designed end to end, ie data staging to visualization tool.  It will satisfy the dev and power analysts through decision makers.  Unlike many legacy platforms, this is not bulky, can be on prem, in the cloud or hosted.  It is a fully browser enabled application, unlike leading newcomers who have bulky client components.  The collaborative capabilities are unique and differentiate this product from leading players.  Lastly, the output is fully HTML5 enabled for mobile consumption.  Competitors have developed siloed device OS apps which are costly and complex to support.","Dundas has been a well kept secret, even though they've been around for 20+ years.  New marketing and partner relationships will deal with this."
Dundas BI Reviews,Laurence,Viamedia,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,Visualizing Data is super easy,,The number of visualizations is great. Nothing is left to the imagination.   The easy to us drag and drop capabilities make going from pure data to visual representations in no time.  The ability to manipulate and massage your data before trying to visualize it is perfect.  Ease of getting up to date versions.,Some features desired still have to be scripted.  Some bugs have been found - but none that the support team haven't fixed in future versions.
Dundas BI Reviews,Brad,Tenaska Power Services,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,Dundas BI allows for rapid extensibility,,The ability for us to write custom extensions to use the product with our highly-customized data solutions,I wish that their support was a bit more responsive to requests the first time.  I sometimes feel like they require more follow-up than I would anticipate.
Dundas BI Reviews,Cameron,GVEA,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,"Frustrating for developers, great for end users once they adapt",,Empowers the end user to take control of their data and manipulate the presentation how they would like instead of having the developers develop the multiple different views for them.,The user interface is very confusing from a developer stand point. There are also numerous strange bugs that will come up in regards to permissions and data driven notifications.
Dundas BI Reviews,Paul,Insightful.Mobi,5.0,4.0,,5.0,,Small Software company seeing a BI functionality for multi-tenanted environment,,Dundas delivers multi-tenancy in an elegant way. It has a great architecture allowing us to provide some powerful reportings options to our clients and take full credit for it.,While they do have quite a few examples of how you can use the environment these could be a lot more substantial. Admittedly any question we have put to them they have managed to cover off through the support desk.

Dundas BI Reviews,Jian,CAMH,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,Overall a very unique and powerful BI visualization tool.,Overall a very good BI tool.  It has so much to offer so that takes users more time to get really good at it.  Most of the time customer service is great.  Sometimes issues raised would get ignored unless ask about it again.,- A lot of existing visualization components - Very simple and clean UI - Support various customization - Open API that gives the users ability to do almost anything,- Deployment issue happens often - System errors that are hard to interpret/troubleshoot - Not enough 'basic' functionality
Dundas BI Reviews,Ravi,TREB,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"Dundas BI is like Pandora's Box. Everytime I use it, there is a new exciting feature/functionality to be found",,"It's really advanced in terms of functionality, visually appealing and yet very simple to use and explore.",Sometimes the feature names are not so intuitive (particularly in the 'Look' tab) to relate to. One needs to do a lot of trial and error to get the desired look of the table/chart/visualization.
Dundas BI Reviews,Derek,NB Power,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,Dundas BI is a great dataviz program with a ton of flexibiltiy. ,,Dundas BI allows you to display data with a large variety of visualization that can match nearly any data set. Dashboard building is simple and intuitive. ,There are some bugs. Notably with the maps feature and some inconsistencies in data cube construction. Troubleshooting can be a pain. 
Dundas BI Reviews,Chris,Satori Group India Pvt Ltd,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,Dundas: One of a kind,,Easy to use and understand. Great customer support team. If stuck with a doubt the support team is always instant in backing with a reply and solution for the same.,Not many How to do videos or academy for beginners to learn the product to get comfortable in the start.
Dundas BI Reviews,Tom,Family HealthCare Network,4.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,,A Powerful Tool with some Amazing Capabilities,,"Product: I can create fantastic data visualizations quickly. Everything is self-contained--from security to data extraction to visualization. I don't have to spend time cobbling things together with JavaScript and bailing wire; I can just create dashboards.    Vendor: They provide great customer service and support for their products and I feel like I'm their only or top customer. I know I'm not, but it feels that way.",It would be nice if their support hours extended a little later for those of us in the Pacific time zone.
Dundas BI Reviews,Edmond,MacLaren McCann,4.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,,Dundas BI for Web Analytics,,"Dundas BI has a very powerful scripting engine for both the frontend and backend. I've only seen a handful of products in the BI space that has scripting capabilities, and nothing comes close to what Dundas BI has to offer.  The in-memory caching feature allows a dashboard to render in only a few seconds. It's truly amazing.","I am currently evaluating version 2 of Dundas BI. It's a relatively new piece of software, so documentation and samples are really lacking."
Dundas BI Reviews,Kimberly,Evergreen Health,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,This product can do anything!,,"And by anything, I mean it. Dundas can create all sorts of visualizations, info graphics & charts like I've never imagined.","It's not really a con, but because there is so many options, it can make using it difficult. I wish making maps was as easy as in Tableau. "
Dundas BI Reviews,Crystal,Kern High School District,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,Loving Dundas so far . . .,We have had a great first week learning and building. It has been challenging in the most productive ways and our trainer is amazing!

Dundas BI Reviews,B.,Center6,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,Cutting edge BI solution. Very little if anything compares.,"This product is extremely flexible and very robust. From a BI and visualization standpoint what you can do with it is limitless. And the support and development team at Dundas are top notch. When you need something they're available AND knowledgeable. In the software world this is a rarity. Only con, from a visualization development standpoint it's still a tool for the business analyst or IT professional. But our users aren't complaining - they LOVE the visualizations we're creating.",,
Dundas BI Reviews,andrew,MWH,3.0,3.0,,3.0,,Dundas BI,used Dunas BI through eBuilder. The product showed good visuals but was not intuitive to build out a dashboard with the data. ,the product has decent looking graphs and images. ,limited functionality especially when integrated with eBuilder
Dundas BI Reviews,Joel,Insurance,4.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,Feature-rich but awkward UI,Love-hate,"There is a nice breadth of features ""out of the box"".",The User Interface in the various designer screens is very awkward.
Dundas BI Reviews,Christopher,Aptiv,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"Affordable, flexible solution for manufacturing operations BI","We needed a self-service BI solution that would cover manufacturing operations dashboards and use cases.  We wanted a tool that would allow for the distribution of centralized common dashboards but also allow for self-service customization.  It needed to connect to multiple disparate data sources, and provide native ETL.  It also needed to allow for real-time refresh capability.  Finally, it needed to be affordable and scalable to our global operations footprint.  DundasBI was the only solution that checked all of these boxes, and so far the tool has been a great help to reducing external spend and internal, custom-coded solutions. ","-Real-time dashboard refresh capability -Built-in ETL -Flexible seat types and affordable licensing -Superior flexibility and customization, without the need for coding -Out of the box performance and usage tracking",Customization and flexibility come at the cost of a steeper learning curve compared to other solutions.  
Dundas BI Reviews,Anonymous,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,Amazing Experience for Your Dashboard's Users,"The Creation GUI is very quirky, but the results are well worth putting up with it. I have never had an idea that I could not eventually create (sometimes, some java script is needed). The fact that they expose all of their API tools to the end user is amazing, and allows you to create some awesome things.","- Support team is very helpful with basic use cases.  - After a dashboard has been created, it looks great and works well for the end user.  - People with zero programming experience are able to create dashboards.","(All very minor things, which might be addressed in future updates) - Data cube creation, metric sets, and dashboards must be created using their GUI- they cannot be generated using scripts or edited as script.  - You cannot copy and paste sections of one dashboard or datacube to another.  - Data cube nodes cannot be copied.  - All programming scripts are stored in an sql database, which means you cannot use version control systems (such as Git Hub)."
Dundas BI Reviews,John-Arne,Schlumberger,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,"Promising, good and high potential but not there yet","Dundas BI is a very good contender in the BI segment and has great potential. At the moment it is a tool for developers proficient with JavaScript and not recommended for end users. There are great potential with DBI. Unfortunately v4 got the wrong focus on non-essential upgrades thus put the bar high for version 5. To compete with Power BI, Tableau and QlikView DBI need much improvement on user-friendliness. If DBI can be really improved on administration and formatting and keeping the flexibility it will surpass most of it's competitors. ","Relatively easy to get started and creating visualizations and dashboards. The scorecard, which is a kind of repeating panel is brilliant and undervalued. The report is a great addition which makes DBI an all-in-one BI tool. Dashboard layers and pop-ups enhances the experience. Data driven notification adds to a useful experience. ETL cube with data warehouse has powerful transformations and much capabilities. The open API with JavaScript makes it flexible beyond expectations. ","Project and file and content management is amongst the worst in class! This need to be completely changed in v5! It's a frustrating experience to organize content. Auto save is okay, but need to be able to decide where. Check in /out is over-used and add frustration to developing dashboards. Poor cube management; need option to process multiple cubes and have incremential processing as option. Need an equation writer for those who is not proficient in JavaScript. Need more formulas for metric sets. Hidden metric sets in dashboards are a bad idea. Properties tab need complete re-organization."
Dundas BI Reviews,RENZI,Willis Towers Watson,4.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,Great BI tool,"Since Dundas BI is fairly new compared to it's competitors expect a steep learning curve, especially on using the API's. With that said, it is quite worth it as you will be rewarded with a product that could deliver a great user experience whether using it as a stand-alone platform or embedding it to your existing ones.","Dundas BI is very easy to use and intuitive. For simple reports, almost everything works right out of the box. For advanced usage, the API's available are astounding. You can control the application without using their UI. (Great for automating certain routine admin tasks!) ","They would have to look into deeper support for OLAP sources. Also, they would have to improve on their documentation, sometimes there are amazing features that are not going to be used because the user would not even know it's there. "

Dundas BI Reviews,Octavian,RomIT Project Consult,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,Dundas BI - Much more than a BI tool,"Overall experience is very good, I like that there is nothing that can't be done with this tool, with regards to user requirements.","Best thing about Dundas BI  is that it is very extendable to user needs and it can accomplish a lot more in a very short development time, comparing to other BI tools on the market which are not so extendable and easy to use. You can also build more than a dashboard with Dundas BI, you can also create software as a service applications with complex navigation systems and all sorts of rules applied to the visualizations and it's data. Speaking of data, it also has a very powerful ETL engine that enables data transformation without needing to know SQL or other query languages.","These is not much to dislike at this tool but if I have to come up with an answer, I will say that the complexity of options for every visualization could be a dislike because it is very time consuming to find everything in the properties tab of each type of viz. This also may be a big like because it enables you to customize everything pixel perfect."
Dundas BI Reviews,Anonymous,,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,Best Flexible BI tool in the market,"Built dashboards which makes our customers day easier , well organized and informative, which otherwise would require customers to use their own analytics to gain insights.","This software provides with a breadth of flexibility in terms of integrations, automated user authentication,different charts available for visualizations.

Dundas BI Reviews,Mohammad,,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,End to End Enterprise BI Solution,"I used Dundas BI for almost the last two years, Dundas BI is Enterprise end to end solution where you can connect to your data through wide range of data sources available and the ability to add extra data sources through its open API, Dundas BI contain embedded ETL engine to transform the data and it allows for multiple data access options (Datawarehouse, In memory analysis and direct connection to data). by using Dundas BI you can build your dashboards, reports and scorecard with friendly interface and with rich library of visualization charts from bar and pie charts and ending with relationship chart and histogram chart. Also Dundas BI allow business users to do their self service analysis with referring back to IT people, I cannot forget their customer support, they have well trained team to support their customers from incidents and issues and service request like helping us in writing Java codes to do amazing things in the solution.    The tools is completely open and it is build over JS and HTML5, this is so amazing since Dundas BI is fully supported on mobiles with all mobile features like pinch to zoom and others.    As Dundas BI have full Java and .Net APIs then it is very easy to integrated Dundas and embedded it in other portals and it has out the box integration with SharePoint.","Flexible tool where you can do what ever you want, I beleive that 95% of use cases can be build in Dundas BI as quick-wins and the rest is possible through JS and HTML5.","I wish Dundas BI to have out the box integration with web-services as this will be helpful and currently not available but it can be done through programming,"

We were searching for a BI offering to present to our clients and stumbled upon Dundas almost by accident. Good thing we did. In hindsight, choosing any product other than Dundas BI would have been the wrong choice. The architecture of Dundas BI uses HTML5, CSS and JavaScript - no legacy technology here. The product is can be deployed on-premise or in the cloud, includes multi-tenant functionality, includes out-of-the-box connectors to an array of data sources, allows for ETL in the application, gives developers granular control over most design elements, the dashboard features are almost limitless and the support team is outstanding.",Flexibility and functionality.,I'll never fully exploit the capabilities of the software - it's simply too massive.
Dundas BI Reviews,Luis,Medidata,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"Explore, analyze and get fast insights of your data in an easy and fast way using Dundas BI. ","I've been working in  Business Intelligence for quite a long time and in the beginning it was hard to explore data and show information in form of data visualizations for the end users. Since I discovered Dundas BI, this task turned to be much more simple and easy to achieve! Dundas Bi has an IDE for developing Dashboards, Reports and Scorecards that uses the last  technologies in web applications developments which makes your life simplier. The smart drag and drop design tools,  the  rich set of data visualizations customizable to the lowermost detail, the style and themes feature,  turns possible to create rich and interactive dashboards in a breeze! Dundas BI comes with an ETL (Export , Transform and Load) layer, where you can clean and prepare your data, this is done using a canvas where you can drag your tables from a data source, choose the columns you want, aggregate them, join with other tables, filter and a lot of interesting features regarding the ETL process. It connects to a lot of data sources: Oracle, Microsoft SqlServer, Excel files, ... It is a collaborative tool, with scheduled reports, based on a metric or not, you can even annotate data points, writing a comment on it in a way that others can see and respond to it! Every view can be exported to excel, pdf, image and even powerpoint.     The management of the software is in the form all in one!  every thing is done in the application,  from user creation  object permissions, overall configuration, project exporting/importing and management!","The drag and drop  feature for creating views is a very productive feature. The ETL is also great, it's easy to use and, for more advanced users, it evens permits to write direct sql against tha data source you choose. Regarding performance it has two possibilities, you can cache in memory or in DBI data warehouse. The collaborative feature of this tool is a must to have feature, I specially like the data driven notification option that could alert you by email when  a specific metric goes behind a threshold or state. ",It needs to take a step further and aboard predicted analytics!  
Dundas BI Reviews,Marin,Riskenomics,4.5,2.5,5.0,5.0,,"A steep learning curve, with great reward at the end of it.",,"Dundas is a conglomeration of expertly coded dashboard development tools and infrastructures. The thing I like most about Dundas is that they are very helpful, the gentleman assigned to me to educate me in the ways of Dundas, was one I will never forget to this day, he was calm, helpful, understanding and with his help I learned Dundas in no time.    I like the way Dundas structure's its Dashboard development, it starts with virtual tables, where the programmer can manually or automatically generate SQL queries, these queries are then used for the basis of adding statistical flavour to the Dashboard, the way this is done is very straight forward. Dundas has a steep unforgiving learning curve, but when you master the fundamentals, the sky really is the limit.    Also their support service is world class, the representatives will assist you in any way they can, they will help you understand what the issue you are facing is and provide a resolution. If they cant help you via email, they will 'WebEx' you, i.e skype call with 2 way screen control.    Everything in Dundas is customizable, charts, graphs and other statistical data can be glossed up and made to look as simple or as plush as the user envisions. You can add formulae, trend analysis and other key statistical methods are employed by Dundas.    They have charts for Finance, Risk analysis and other key statistical methodologies. All of these charts can be jazzed up with scripts so that you can Drill down and filter through the data you want in order to get the right Business Intelligence feel to your work.    Dundas supports the Data Cube, It supports Microsoft, Oracle, MySQL, EXCEL, it has export capabilities onto Excel, so those clients which prefer their data in Spreadsheets can manually export directly from the dashboard. Everything in Dundas is designed to give you the most professional feel possible at all times!","Dundas, for the good of it's users needs to publish more comprehensive educational equipment to train it's users, it is very hard to get to an expert level in Dundas without some help from your Friends in Dundas. I would love to see Dundas publish university style lectures, with step by step guides that show every aspect of the working sphere. With adequate educational material, one would be able to gain adept or even artisan status with the Tool on their own."
Dundas BI Reviews,Zaman,Agri-Service LLC,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,Dundas embodies data visulization,"I think overall, I would not rule out Dundas, even with it's so called quirks. Dundas staff showed very much that they listen to users, even those that haven't purchased and have taken my criticisms to heart. Since we're not talking about a 2017 Toyota car or whatever, I feel it's important to note the constant evolution of any progressive software company. The complaints stated could be obsolete in a mere few weeks. ","Dundas seems to really understand the need of handling big data and the tools needed to process these overwhelming mountains of 1's and 0's into actionable data. While working with the demo of Dundas I was able to create a very helpful tree-map that showed me the dissection of purchases comparatively from vendor to vendor to evaluate our performance or ""loyalty"" per vendor by item category and so on. ","The U.I. of Dundas, while quite robust, seems to concern me in regards to the amount of boxes, checks, and clicks and long clicks I have to make to merely navigate my way through the program. I would rather see more keyboard shortcuts and less ""Windows Vista"" popups that slow my work. I felt like the settings I would implement would get lost. For instance, I would filter the vendors that weren't pertinent to my particular evaluation, then also the item categories that I wasn't interested in working with. Later on, when in the final building of the dashboard I wanted to add a checkbox filter to allow the end user to select individual item categories and be able to view 1 or all 20-30 at a time. Strangely, even though I filtered (or so I though) this data in the data cube level, I realized that the checkbox list populated with ALL the categories. This was quite frustrating. Also, I have yet to figure out how to go from an unfinished dashboard back to the data metrics screen where I built the KPI to start with. Unless i'm mistaken, it seems you have to go back to your saved metric set and then create a new dashboard after edits. Hopefully I'm wrong in my assessment of this but even so, the answer did not seem to be intuitive .  "
Dundas BI Reviews,Buck,IT Services,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,Dundas BI Earned Our Decision,"We have years of data that need mined.  This requires the stakeholders to play with the data.  We can give them all the metrics we can define, but when a user gets the chance to turn the data on its side and inside out, and then when they can bounce it around between each other, mark it up and change the visualizations on demand, it allows them to work from intuition.  We are striving to help our users work from intuition, as well as from logic, to make observations; and, Dundas BI offers the ability to feed intuition.","Dundas BI is a solid platform: it's more than a tool.  With solid row-level security, a hefty selection of visualizations and the opportunity to present our user base with the ability to play with data, they won our vote.  We compared them against: Tableau, Sisense, Domo and iDashboards.  These comparative products had strengths as well, but when we made our decision, it was because Dundas gives our end users great control over visualizing what they see without unnecessary programming as well as our ability to use native SQL views we've already written with no need for modification.  This in tandem with row-level security that we control at the data level made a perfect fit for our organization.","I like to get up and going intuitively.  There wasn't a quick-start guide on how to create your first dashboard: it was pieces of learning.  Having now gone through the majority of their 100-level and 200-level courses and having created a number of assets, I can see why Dundas wants you to do their training...but for heavy programming go-getters, I wish there had been a quick document to start.  They did, however, respond amazingly as they hit my demands for learning head on and answered my questions rapidly, even assigning me access to a technician for a few days while I was in crunch mode."
Dundas BI Reviews,Kris,Center6,4.5,2.5,5.0,5.0,,Comprehensive BI = Dundas BI,,"Dundas BI is the most comprehensive BI platform available (trust me, we looked at BI products for almost a year before choosing DBI).  Our three main criteria when selecting a BI platform for our clients were visualizations, reports and mobile.  DBI covers all three criteria (with a codicil that will show up in the ""What I like least"" section) and the licensing costs are reasonable.  Key features that are crazy cool: 1) DBI is data-source agnostic, 2) the scripting capability allows developers to do just about anything, 3) DBI is based on HTML5 technology (other well-known BI products are based on proprietary and/or outdated technology) and 4) the DBI support team (including the development team) provides excellent customer service.    For us, as a small software company, there is always the chance to second-guess the selection of a BI product.  This was a critical decision for us as the BI software we deploy to our clients will directly impact the viability of our organization and our ability to stay relevant in the coming years.  It is a testament to the DBI product and the Dundas team that the answer to the question ""Did we select the right software?"" is always a resounding ""Yes"".","The one knock on DBI is the lack of a mobile app.  User experience is the number one factor for us when delivering products to our clients.  Currently, mobile data is delivered via web pages.  DBI would be greatly enhanced if the mobile experience was via a mobile app (even if the ""app"" was simply a wrapper the redirects users to the web page)."

","Flexibility to do whatever you want, Open API and known scripting languages like HTML5 and JS where 99% of your word can be accomplished through drag and drop including preparing the connections to database, you can do all the task which usually have to be done through SQL language by using Dundas and only drag and drop like join, sort , filter, union, aggregation and more.",The tool doesn't support the 3D Charts even it is clear that 3D charts are not professional. 
Dundas BI Reviews,Andrew,Decisions,4.0,3.5,5.0,3.5,,Dundas Developer for the last 3 years,,"1. Data Visualisation is what Dundas do, and do well at; as opposed to many BI vendors, who offer a broader range of functionality but end up being a jack of all trades, and a master of none.     2. It's a difficult balance for a product to be easy to use, as well as being flexible. It's subjective, but I feel that they have the balance right.  3. I can't speak highly enough about the support team.","1. Exports to Powerpoint, etc... are needed.  2. Ability to work off line, with everything nicely cached. I agree the benefit will diminish over the years, but other products, like Microstrategy, do. Senior managers like this.  3. A better way to add comments; something like Cognos.  4. More an issue with the previous Dundas product, and though rare, but we had a couple of cases where newer versions could often resolve one issue raised, but result in something else no longer working, which made us look a rather silly. With new versions, don't assume anything, and test thoroughly again.  5. Greater presence in Europe."

Moreover, the price od dundas is reasonable comparing to the features that it provides and cheaper comparing to other products in the market.   Later on, our requirements increased but dundas BI was flexible enought so we did all them. In dundas BI, think what to do rather than how to do it or if it is doable or not.  One year later, dundas become the central portal for every department including Executives ,IT, sales, and marketing. By giving other departments  small training on dundas bi, they started to build their reports and dashboards, our role was to prepare the connection to databases and the data cubes only.

The ETL process is very quick so creating the data cubes isn't rocket science. Once created a cube can be used immediately to begin providing very high-quality visualization to customers, or super users in analytics-heavy departments can start creating their own visualization for their members. Setting up users is as easy as typing in their name and setting permissions is fairly intuitive, so it only takes a few minutes.

Our ERP uses IBM DB2, and Dundas letting us tap into a wealth of details that would otherwise be buried in thousand-page reports. Never before has the ability to profile previous periods and events had such speed and accuracy (our data goes back over 15 years). The access and sumarization of this data is revealing patterns and insight to the business processes. We've only just begun and are excited about our game-changing experiences!",The flexibility.

I have database experience in many facets, but the concept of the cube was new to me as well as slicers, hierarchy, measures, etc.  Once I got my project going, it made more since.  I am enjoying Dundas very much and know it has so many more features that our company could utilize.  Highly recommend.","If you have ever wished for a BI product that you can change just this item, or enhance this item or be able to drag and drop this one, then Dundas is for you!  It has everything you can think of and many features that you did not!  I also enjoy the new THE CUBE community where you can ask questions, work on your skills and earn rewards.","It wasn't intuitive at first.  Once you get into it, it gets better.  I found that I am sailing right along, got into a new area, and could not move the handles or anything on the grid.  Come to find out you have to click off the grid, then it shows you the dimensions.  That is one example.  There are non-standard methods, but once you know it, it is easy."
Dundas BI Reviews,Rafeek,CH2M,4.0,4.0,,4.0,, A fresh view of analytics with Dundas BI,,"Having used other dashboard and reporting softwares, Dundas brings a breath of freshness into the analytics domain. The rendering of graphs, charts and other visualization is very appealing to novice as well as experienced users. The fact that it is web based with the flexibility to connect to a raft of datasets makes it a strong contender. ","As the resultant information that Dundas produces are viewed in different kinds of mediums, the responsive design architecture needs to a bit more intuitive and easy to design and develop. Similar to the sandbox view, there could be other predefined views targeting mobile and tablets."

Dundas BI Reviews,Elmar,Reports BV,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,Dundas BI review,Dundas BI is a very flexible tool to create the most creative dashboards and or reports. If there is something you can't figure out you can contact there support and you will always get an answer within a day. ,The number of visualisations and the flexibility especially when you also start scripting,At the moment we have some difficulties with the export but that it also our own fault.

Dundas BI Reviews,Priyabrata,GrayMatter Software Services Pvt Ltd,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,It's a very good tool for creating cubes from different sources including direct excel sheets. ,It's not that much complex as compared to other BI tools. The user will understand all of its features not more than one week. ,"Very user friendly, won't take much time to understand the UI part, whether it's related to creating a dashboard or creating cubes, measures and dimensions. Even you can create you custom cube by joining tables by simple sql queries. Dundas has its own cloud server, hence when you create any new project including dashboards, charts, measures and dimensions..It uploads everything to its secured cloud drive. It simply took me 1 week to understand the complete functionality of dundas all by myself. Hence I would say it won't take much time to get familiar with it even for a non-technical guy. ",The tool is very useful and user friendly. The only part I felt it's lacking while writing sql queries by using cascading functionality. It won't support or run using this type of queries.

Bugs and feature requests are taken seriously and are resolved quickly in version releases.,Issues related to integration and infrastructure with other platforms are not easily resolved. I'm not sure it can be blamed on the vendor as the product itself has very few problems. It would be nice to have integration experts on their team though ot quickly troubleshoot and resolve these problems.

Dundas makes the learning easy, with rich documentation, videos, example scripts, and a wonderful support team. Once you've mastered the basics, creating powerful dashboards in Dundas is surprisingly quick and easy. Dynamic elements give our users the flexibility they need without complex scripting being required, and I love the ability to use Layers for a cleaner design experience. ","While we understand the good reasons behind switching from Dundas script to JavaScript, this transition is a bit of an extra learning curve for our team. "
Dundas BI Reviews,Michelle,Hometown Health,4.5,4.5,5.0,4.5,,New to Dundas BI Platform,,"Dundas BI is fairly intuitive, which makes for a quick win.  This product is extremely flexible, dynamic, and easy to use. The support staff will go far and above in assisting you, they will help you truly understand what the issue is so you can learn from it not just repair it.","Part of what I appreciate about the product also frustrates me.  It is so customizable that you can get lost in customizing and forget about ‘why’ you were developing the visualization to begin with.  I am new to this product and have found myself calling support because I have ""customized myself"" into an error, but never fear the support team always manages to untangle my mess.      We were somewhat hoping to reuse some of the datasets we created in Dundas for other projects but unfortunately the way the warehouse it set up it is not possible to reuse the data (that I am aware of)."
Dundas BI Reviews,Anonymous,,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,A  great tool for creating pixelperfect dashboards.,,"The strength of this software (compared to other software for dashboard) is its ability to create graphics, KPIs and totally pixel perfect objects. On other software that I use often I have difficulty in satisfying the client's graphic requests, through Dundas the problem does not arise, indeed it is possible to edit every single object in the smallest detail.  ","In my opinion the interface is not very attractive, the graphs are functional and clear (which is what we need in practical terms) but could improve a bit 'the graphic aspect that I think is still a bit' too ""simple"".  Even the use is not the easiest initially, you have to acquire a little 'knowledge of the software but nothing too difficult."
